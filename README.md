# Recipe-System
A project that I did to make various recipes for my cooking simulator. The recipes are use a data structure of an N-Tree. You can edit the recipes visually in Unity.

The data of the food (name and GameObjects) are stored in ScriptableObjects so you are able to use the same ingredient in different recipes without having to set the data multiple times.
